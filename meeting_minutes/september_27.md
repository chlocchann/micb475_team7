# Meeting Minutes - September 27
* Have meeting agenda finalized and sent to Ritu by 10am on Friday or if have pressing matter to discuss at meeting, let Ritu know day prior to meeting on Thursday
* Document script, output files, all meeting agenda/minutes -> publish in manuscript at end of year

## Tiffany: Anemia during Infancy -> includes additional data on top of initial 12 month data -> cannot compare 6 & 12 month data since it is something that has been done before
*   Must be something quite specific since it is quite popular -> low hanging fruits are gone
*   May have to do some digging to find something novel

## Wendy: interested in anemia & parkinsons data sets -> lots of data, may have some low hanging fruits 
* Should still be specific since it has been used quite a bit
  
## Catherine: interested in the parkinsons data sets and microbiomes of individuals and environmental surfaces in a shared dorm

## Chloe: interested in the microbiome in wild and captive animals data sets and microbiomes of individuals and environmental surfaces in a shared dorm
* Captive & wild animals data set has been the least touched
* Herbivore vs carnivore & captive vs non-captive have been done before, have not done cross-zoo study but may not have that metadata
  
## As group, leaning towards environmental data or towards medical datasets?
* Group does not have any particular preference towards either -> mostly just want to identify question that would be interesting to delve into further
  
## Evelyn suggested to do more exploratory modelling project -> would be more computation heavy compared to more biological heavy
* Model would be R script that loops to look at every single variable in the dataset to identify if there is significance that exists
* Allows to identify which variables are interesting -> sure to get significant results, since we are chasing significance
* Can choose to graph how diversity varies or how function varies based on those variables
* Can hone in on a specific variable of interest
* Heisitant to do dorms, parkinsons or anemia datasets because the metadata is quite intense
* Would suggest to do the captive vs wild animals one -> no groups in past have ever found significant results, would be the first
* Able to choose how complex to build the model
* Columbia & Familial Dysautonomia was used previously for exploratory modelling
* Can also pick a different paper! 
  
## Try to come to next meeting with more concrete ideas that we want to stick to
* Meeting agenda should contain any questions, concerns, if something is interesting, updates, graphs, etc.
* Only email about meeting agenda when something is urgent

## Questions
* can use dpylr package for assignment 4

## ACTION ITEMS 
* Email Evelyn for links to specific UJEMI papers that performed exploratory modelling
