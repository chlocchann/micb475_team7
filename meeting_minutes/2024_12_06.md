# Meeting Minutes - December 6

## Manuscript questions 
* General:
  * Same text order for discussing variables: decide whether we do diet or gut fermentation first 
  * Terminology: Animals or mammals → or interchangeable?

* Results:
  * Currently, only picrust is split into 2 paragraphs one for each section. Should we be consistent?
Doesn’t really matter (keep ISA and Deseq as just one paragraph each, should keep concise)

## Remaining things to do 
* Update github repository with evt + citation (how do we cite in our manuscript?) 
  * Make the github repository public
  * Link it
  * Add a different section to the manuscript: data availability: “all scripts and data used is available here at  ___” before acknowledgements section

* Finish discussion 
  * Start off with a results summary
  * Summarize trends
  * How does trend in Deseq match trend in ISA?
  * Merging our results to understand as a whole 
  * Is diversity supposed to be different for diff diet/gut types or should they not?
* Does it match data/not in literature
  * Editing manuscript 
  * Double check methods is consistent + enough details for what we did 
  * Figure legends

## Wendy
* Figure legend Q
* Example: “Table Z. Captivity reduces microbial abundance across gut fermentation types. Significant differential ASVs were defined as adjusted p-values < 0.05 and |log2FoldChange| > 1.5, with wild population as reference group. Log2FoldChange values greater than 0 are reflected as increases in ASV in captivity compared to wild populations, and vice versa for values less than 0.”
* Confusion about where to mention supplementary graph: methods? Figure legend of tables?
