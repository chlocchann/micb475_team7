# Meeting Minutes - November 8

## Wendy
* Sample size =1000, positive ASVs blasting to confirm species (esp Esch-shigella)
	* “53d42797b8ac1fa460a02c8a2904581e" = (halo)pseudomonas		
	* "F50defe8cf4a491bc5377919cec7e331" = E. coli
* sample size =10000, PNGs MICB_475 DESeq2 PNGs.pptx:
	* Mostly negative values, but yes positive ASVs for all graphs + identified groups for Omnivores (no groups in size=1000)
	* Every dot is an ASV, the horizontal lines are error bars
	* So likely still can conclude: overall a loss of diversity with captivity (though specific taxonomy groups differ depending on category & group) across mammals
	* Phylum present in all graphs (3): bacteriodota, firmicutes, proteobacteria
	* Phylum present in all but one graph (3): verrucomicrobiota (carnivores), actinobacteria (foregut), spirochaeta (non-ferm)
* sample size= 10000, positive ASVs MICB475_DESeq2 positive ASVs.xlsx:
* Sample data summary:
	* Herbivores = 16 ASVs, 1009 samples
	* Omnivores = 14 ASVs, 57 samples
	* Carnivores = 7 ASVs, 281 samples
	* Foregut = 14 ASVs, 337 samples
	* Hindgut = 2 ASVs, 67 samples
	* Nonfermentor = 26 ASVs, 885 samples
* Positive ASV summary:
	* 79 total: 21  reoccuring, 32 unique
		* look into all of them? Look into reoccuring only? Leave it as a supplementary without analysis and state it as future directions?
* If decided on analyzation, suggest reoccuring over all to see if there's anything special
	* Make violin plots instead + organize naming of phylum 
	* TA ask Evelyn: whether we can use Excel 

## Tiffany
* Drafted out a plan for the manuscript: discuss roles Manuscript Planning Document - MICB 475
	* I can draft the first 3 sections before nov 15 (since I have no coding to do)?
* Discuss: First draft of manuscript done by 22nd? (TA can look over it 2 times before due date)
	* TA can’t comment on our paper before we submit but we can discuss 
* Discuss: start slides after 22nd, draft done by 29th?

## Mya 
* Will take lead on conclusion, discussion, future directions
	* Discuss ideas for these at the next meeting and then can start writing/ refining

## Chloe
* No issues with QIIME2 portion of pathway -> exported pathway abundance file to RStudio
* Started PICRUSt2 -> ran into issue surrounding amount of data available in OchHMC & GutFermenterHMC columns -> correlating data specifically to wild vs captive status? 
	* Compromised by editing metadata table to reflect wild vs captive status in the meantime
		* Should write code at the end for editing metadata
	* Ex. For diet: “C - CAPTIVE” “C - WILD” 
* Ran through code and generated filtered abundance tables for each category (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, non-fermenter, hindgut fermenter, foregut fermenter)
* ERROR: for omnivore, only 2 wild omnivore samples -> heatmap only reflects captive omnivores despite output stating that wild samples are depicted?
* ERROR: for omnivores, herbivores, hindgut fermenters, foregut fermenters, no variance detected between captive & wild samples? 
* STILL TO DO: volcano plots & DESEq2 portion of pathway
