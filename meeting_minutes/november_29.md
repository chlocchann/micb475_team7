# Meeting Minutes - November 29

## Wendy
* Problem with collapsing phylum classifications (e.g p__fermicutes.1 and p__fermicutes.2 are identified as separate things), resulting in range of + and - values in fold change; decided to generate bar graph without removing numerical identifiers MICB475_DESeq2 PNGs.pptx
  * Results: abundance generally  decreases regardless of category/variable
* Also tried generating an overview with R and organised manually
  *Q: could we still conclude on phylum info with DESeq?
    *If so: Proteobacteria were present in all diet type categories, Spirochaetota were found in all gut fermentation categories, and both Bacteroidota and Firmicutes appeared consistently across all categories of both variables

## Chloe 
* Presentation (Captive vs. Wild Animals Presentation - MICB 475)
	* Keep same split for slides creation as paper? 
		* Background -> Tiffany
		* ISA (Taxonomic Results) -> Christine
		* DESEq2 (Taxonomic Results) -> Wendy
		* PICRUSt2 (Functional Results) -> Chloe
		* Conclusions & Future Directions -> Mya

## Tiffany
* presentation
	* decide on a title for our paper/presentation 
	* mostly done my slides in terms of vision: feedback welcomed :)) 
	* I’m splitting ISA and Deseq2 into 2 obj, is that ok? 
	* what is the purpose of ISA in our analysis / how does comparing the number of indicator species for wild versus captive in each category help?
		* the original plan (I think) was to examine these indicator species to see if they contribute to functional differences in the host + add more evidence if it complements DESEq data, but we have too many… 
	* Can we organize each aim into ABC and continue this format for results so it’s clearer?
* what does this mean (in presentation rubric): All point form text is in full statements
* do we need references in our slides?
* results section thoughts
	* ISA: last week, beecause we had so many indicator species, we were comparing the number of total indicator species for wild versus captive in every category of the variables. So in our results, should we be talking about these total numbers OR about specific species that we observe? 
	* i think we don’t include (stat = 0.993, p = 0.005) in results, is this right?
*discussion section thoughts
	*should we format it more as a story for each variable? Instead of separating it like ISA, then DESEq, then PICRUSt. Should we go over all of these for 1 variable so we can link the 3 techniques together and the biological relevance of our findings?
