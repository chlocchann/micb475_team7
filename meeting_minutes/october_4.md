# Meeting Minutes - October 4

# Chosen Dataset
* Captive vs Wild Animals? -> original study looked at effect of captivity on mammalian gut microbiome diversity (alpha/beta diversity differences & specific taxa they were associated with)
* Metadata categories include: 
* animal type
* location (ie. from zoo/park)
* country
* Taxonomy (ie. phylum, class, order, family, genus, species)
* Activity (ie. crepuscular, diurnal, nocturnal
* Diet
* Trophic level
* Conservation status

# Exploratory Modelling Project 
* UJEMI papers from Dr. Sun: ​​
* https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/199531.
* https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198186

# Aim of Project
* CLARIFY: would the overarching question in the beginning for an exploratory modelling project just be to see what metadata characteristics are associated with increased/decreased microbial diversity in the mammalian gut microbiome? 
* after identifying specific metadata characteristics -> define research question (ex. what demographic/geographic factors are associated with increased/decreased gut microbiome diversity?)
